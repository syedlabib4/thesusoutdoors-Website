    <h2>Connection</h2>
    <p>
We connect with the best producers in the world, those with generational knowledge and those who also share our values of accountability, transparency and sustainability.

We stay in the region, we break bread, we laugh and share stories, we get to know the culture and community, and most importantly, we work closely to make better shoes, for People and the Planet.

<div class="text-boxes">
     <h2>Community</h2>
    <p>
Our commitment centers around ensuring that the People and the Planet are considered at every stage of our value chain. We have aligned ourselves with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals to make sure we are always at the forefront of addressing important issues like Ocean Pollution, Climate Change and Economic Inequalities.

<div class="text-boxes">
     <h2>Good Design</h2>
    <p>
We believe in good design as a way of reducing waste. We focus on what matters: material make-up, design simplicity, sustainability, quality, comfort and functional integrity. We create versatile shoes that you actually want to wear, on-or-off the trail year round.

        <h1>Production</h1>
        <p>
            At Thesus we commit to working in regions in the world that have overarching systems and good governance in place to support a decent standard of living. We spend months finding the right people to partner with, live in the regions, and build friendships with their teams.

To form partnerships with factories, we move to the regions where we operate. Our founders get to know the owners and employees and take the time to understand their current sustainability standards and future ambitions for how we can together work toward operating within planetary boundaries, centering community wellbeing and the planet. This process is a personal one, that takes the vetting process well beyond certifications and helps to ensure we are partnering with suppliers whose values are already in alignment with Thesus’ goals of operating within planetary boundaries with a focus on nature based solutions.

As of July 2022 we have moved 100% of our production to Portugal, beating our goal of an HDI rank by 3% achieving an HDI 0.864.
